Inverse Kinematics Solver
=========================

This is a 2D IK-solver. Given a limb consisting of any number of bones and a 2D 
coordinate at any point, the joints will rotate to bring the tip of the limb to rest
at the point. An elbow constraint can be turned on, restricting joints from rotating 
more than 180 degrees in one direction. This causes the limb to form more comfortable
positions.

I have lost the makefile for this project so the code is provided as is. An exe is 
provided in bin should you wish to run it. The SDL.dll must remain in the same 
directory as the .exe in order for keyboard input to work.

Controls
========

Q or Esc         Exit the application.
E                Toggle 'elbow' constraint.
R                Reset.
A                Add bone.
S                Remove bone.
Z,X,C,V,B,N,M    Move to preset target positions.
Arrow Keys       Manually move target.

Libraries and Toolkits
======================

OpenGL is used for graphics.
GLUT is used to display them.
Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) is used for keyboard input.
